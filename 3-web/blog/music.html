        <h4>A Performer</h4>
        <article>
            As a performer, I enjoy playing multitude of styles of music written for flute. I particularly adore studying Baroque music and its improvisational style, something that is sadly missing from the modern classical flute playing. I also enjoy playing and learning the new extended techniques that go beyond the traditional idea of flute playing, such as singing and playing, beatboxing, and other ways to produce sound with flute.

            I have had good fortune to be a featured soloist at various orchestras, and to play with many different groups. My dream is to bring classical music closer and more accessible to the general public, stepping out of its former (and formal) ways, often associated with eliticism.

        <h4>A Teacher</h4>
        <article>
            We all know the question, "what do you want to be when you grow up?" When I was asked the question for the first time in the kindergarden, I answered "teacher," and it still holds true years later. I have been teaching in some capacity or another ever since college, and I have experience as a math tutor, a volunteer trainer, and of course, a flute teacher, as well as teaching my cat to perform various tricks.

            I aim to teach holistically, so students not only learn the techniques and the materials for developing their flute playing, but also the whys and the context that goes along with it. I firmly believe that background information is just as important, if not more, in cultivating the big picture understanding of music making that will allow the student to be self-sufficient and motivate to teach themselves even without the teacher.

        <h4>A Repair Technician</h4>
        <article>
            A graduate of Minnesota State College - Souteast's Band Instrument Repair Program, I worked as a woodwind repair technician, servicing small woodwind instruments. The precise and the intricate nature of the trade opened my eyes to appreciate the precise machines that are musical instruments, and the craftmanship and the love that goes into manufacturing even the student level instruments.
